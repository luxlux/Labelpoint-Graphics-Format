# labelpoint-graphics-format
Node.js Implementation of the Labelpoint Graphics Format. It allows to build a graphic, pixel by pixel, used by barcode printers which speak the Labelpoint printer language. (Some label printers from IMAJE, Markpoint, Honeywell speak this language.) It can be used to convert pictures into this format, or to print graphics on these printers without having a driver for this printer. (The printer have to be added to cups as RAW printer)
